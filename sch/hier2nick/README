These are simple hierarchical schematics intended for testing
of lepton-netlist tool from the Lepton EDA [1] suite and how
it works with more than two levels of hierarchy.



Files
=====

1. main.sch - main, top-level schematic
2. cs.sch   - second-level schematic
3. rr.sch   - third-level schematic

Other files are listed at the end of the document
in the 'Directory Structure' section.



Test how netlist is generated
=============================

$ lepton-netlist -o - -g PCB main.sch

Replace "PCB" with other backend you need to test.



Test how printed circuit board files are produced
=================================================

$ lepton-sch2pcb project.sch2pcb

This command should generate 3 output files:
1) brd.cmd
2) brd.net
3) brd.pcb

Open brd.pcb file in the pcb [2] layout editor and then
click on the following main menu items:
1. 'Select->Disperse all elements'
2. 'File->Load netlist', select brd.net file and press OK

Then press ":" and in the opened command prompt type:

  ExecuteFile(brd.cmd)

and press Enter.

Click on the 'Connect->Optimize rats nest' main menu item
and test if all the connections match the schematics.



Directory Structure
===================

- board.done/: contains pcb files with complete, routed circuit board
- fp/: contains pcb footprints used
- img/: folder with exported schematic and pcb PNG images
- sym/: symbols used in the schematic diagrams
- overview.sch: the test circuit in one schematic file
- cs.sym, rr.sym: symbols representing sub-schematics
- gafrc, geda.conf: configuration files
- project.sch2pcb: input file for lepton-sch2pcb
